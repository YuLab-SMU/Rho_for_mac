# Rho 0.4.0-dev.33 Cross-Platform Candidate Checklist

Status: historical superseded source-only contract; deterministic Provider-
discovery repair, file-lane test repair, AGPL LIC-1/LIC-2, and SP-READY1 were
protected-integrated, but no `0.4.0-dev.33` candidate, tag, Release, or public
artifact was created. PR #48 and PR #50 subsequently changed user-visible
focus and reading-position behavior, so the next installed acceptance package
uses the fresh `0.4.0-dev.34` identity. All uncompleted signing, candidate,
installed-release, MAC5, publication, and updater gates remain open and are
non-composable with this historical record.

Date: 2026-08-11
Last updated: 2026-08-12

Change class: D1 correction of a nondeterministic test fixture plus the
required D4 single-use replacement development identity

Risk: R1 for test-only timeout-fixture behavior; R4 for hosted candidate,
signing/notarization, Release, update site, or publication action

Owning documents: CRED-UX3 owns the production Provider-discovery timeout,
bounds, redaction, and error classes. CRED-UX3-R1 owns only deterministic
verification of that existing behavior. WS2-R1-R1 and RENAME-RECOVERY-R1 retain
the installed editor-envelope correction carried forward from rejected
`dev.32`. The macOS arm64 specification owns packaging and trust gates. This
checklist alone owns the exact `0.4.0-dev.33` source identity and any future
candidate, installed, MAC5, publication, or updater evidence.

Authorization: after reviewing candidate run `31552396659`, its exact failure,
and the focused repair plan, the project owner explicitly instructed
`修复并推送` on 2026-08-11. This authorizes the bounded test-fixture repair,
synchronized replacement identity, complete affected validation, scoped
commit, upstream branch push, and Draft PR. It does not waive protected merge,
candidate, installed, Windows-signing, MAC5, publication, or updater gates.

After subsequently directing the next version to be merged and published, the
project owner instructed the agent to complete all remaining required work on
2026-08-12. That activates the bounded AGPL LIC-2 prerequisite: fixed
cross-platform license resources, About legal notice/reveal action, deterministic
contracts, and fail-closed macOS candidate resource verification. It authorizes
source implementation, validation, review, a scoped PR, and protected merge.
It does not authorize candidate construction before all source and Windows-
signing gates pass, and it does not waive installed, MAC5, publication, or
updater acceptance.

The owner's instruction to complete every remaining required item also
activates SP-READY1 under
`docs/plans/active-2026-08-11-signpath-application-readiness-spec.md`: remove
automatic update-network admission, add the truthful public policy and
ownership surfaces required before a SignPath application, validate them, and
stop at protected integration/external readiness. It does not authorize a
candidate or represent SignPath approval.

`0.4.0-dev.32` is immutable and rejected. Its Windows artifact, source checks,
and failed macOS candidate result cannot be relabelled or composed into this
identity.

## Exact Identity

| Field | Required value | Current evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application version | `0.4.0-dev.33` | Cargo/lock, Tauri, npm/lock, frontend mock/cache, workflow defaults, release-contract tests, roadmap, checklist, and `NEWS.md` synchronized |
| `rho.bridge` version | `0.1.14` | unchanged; no exported R package contract changes |
| `rho.agent` version | `0.1.5` | unchanged; no exported R package contract changes |
| Store schema | `12` | unchanged; no persistence schema changes |
| Release tag/name | `v0.4.0-dev.33` / `Rho 0.4.0-dev.33` | reserved replacement identity only; no tag, artifact, or Release exists |
| Source repository | `YuLab-SMU/Rho` | authoritative integration target |
| Candidate source | future exact upstream default-branch commit after external signing readiness and production signing integration | upstream `main` `e6fec3ecc286db93aa38c227e896ef077bdf17bd` contains the integrated source repairs, AGPL LIC-1/LIC-2, and SP-READY1; no candidate exists |
| Windows/macOS artifacts | exact `dev.33` candidate only | not built |
| Release decision | source repair authorized; release `NO-GO` | every downstream artifact and acceptance gate remains open |

The identity is single-use. Any artifact-producing failed run or later
user-visible source change consumes it and requires another version.

## Repair Contract

- Production `reqwest` client construction, 15-second total timeout, one-
  request limit, no-redirect/no-retry policy, 1 MiB response bound, credential
  handling, redaction, and `timeout` error projection remain byte-for-byte
  unchanged.
- The regression server used for timeout verification must accept and record
  the request but never write a status line, headers, or body. A successful or
  empty discovery response is therefore not a competing test outcome.
- The test client retains an explicit short total timeout. The server retains
  a longer bounded read watchdog so a broken timeout cannot hang CI forever;
  watchdog closure must not be misreported as a timeout pass.
- The regression continues to prove the serialized response omits the injected
  credential. Existing oversized-body and adjacent discovery tests remain
  unchanged.
- No application UI, settings schema, Provider endpoint, model/routing state,
  credential source, network authority, persistence, project, execution, or
  release policy changes.

## Local Implementation And Verification Evidence

The test-only implementation extracts the existing bounded request reader and
adds a stalled server that records the request, writes no HTTP response, and
waits for client closure under a five-second read watchdog. The client uses an
explicit 250 ms total timeout. The response must classify as `timeout`, omit
the injected credential, and prove the expected `/v1/models` request reached
the server. Existing success, redirect, credential, oversized-body, parser,
endpoint, and settings-preservation tests remain unchanged.

Local source evidence passes:

- the exact regression once with visible output and 50 additional independent
  Cargo-process repetitions without any retry-after-failure;
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, locked all-target workspace check, and locked
  full workspace tests (desktop 176 passed plus one opt-in Keychain test
  ignored by design; server 59; store 108; every other executed suite passed);
- `node --check desktop/dist/app.js` and all 56 deterministic frontend/release
  contract scripts;
- complete `rho.bridge` and `rho.agent` local test suites;
- candidate-release and update-site dry runs plus the macOS Ark bootstrap
  failure fixtures; and
- `git diff --check`.

The deliberate post-test review hashed all `agent_llm.rs` source before its
`#[cfg(test)]` boundary in both upstream `main` and the worktree. Both hashes
are
`6ddba16e8794f76e30d1ec80d5a6df3ea043c1750dc2d635eb677e3c52316ee6`,
proving production Provider-discovery code is unchanged. Review also found no
new dependency, schema, credential, network, persistence, project, execution,
UI, or mutation authority and no blocking contract deviation.

## Required Source Evidence

1. **PASS** — the focused timeout regression passes 51 consecutive local
   executions, including 50 independent Cargo processes.
2. **PASS** — the full `rho-desktop` target and locked Rust workspace pass
   without rerun-until-green normalization.
3. **PASS** — Rust format/check, all deterministic frontend/release contracts,
   both R package suites, and `git diff --check` pass.
4. **PASS** — separate post-test review proves production discovery source is
   byte-identical and finds no blocking deviation.
5. **PASS** — PR #43 exact head passed macOS/Windows stable and Rust 1.88.0 in
   run `31557415624` and merged as `3a3546bd76cc11761263a5af8e060ba73a4a0580`;
   AGPL PR #30 exact head passed the same four identities in run `31558086732`
   and merged as `f37276940499d80b4898f630d3c683e13a554a3f`.
6. **PASS** — LIC-2 exact head `bffc0a2ecbd6c05778e1b4d3de42c4b07dbd58f5`
   passed all four hosted identities in run `31560071505` and merged to
   upstream `main` as `39701241206df2e4492d1539e725500c6795c09e`.
7. **PASS** — SP-READY1 exact head
   `ee7100866d547c0a43ba814464a960e29846fa43` passed all four hosted
   identities in run `31561610111`, merged through PR #45 as
   `e6fec3ecc286db93aa38c227e896ef077bdf17bd`, and passed all four exact-main
   identities in run `31562213275`. Update-site run `31562817460`, private
   vulnerability reporting, and no-bypass default-branch ruleset `20728497`
   pass without creating a candidate or changing the published `dev.24`
   development manifest identity.
8. **PASS** — PR #46 exact head
   `0e618c8eda9f9dcfe43ac95669d16fc27791cb6f` passed all four hosted
   identities in run `31563972114`, received independent latest-push CODEOWNER
   approval, merged as `71dfd3a442a3a22abacd8a49e400ff8deae1760a`, and
   passed all four exact-main identities in run `31576354218`. Update-site run
   `31646300758` published and live-verified the linked attribution, pending-
   application disclosure, visible Windows/macOS uninstall instructions, and
   truthful unsigned-Windows state from current main. Published `dev.24`
   identity, platform sizes, and hashes remained unchanged; no candidate, tag,
   Release, or signing request was created.

Pre-merge update-site review found that making `license_boundary` globally
mandatory also rejected immutable published `0.4.0-dev.24` evidence and would
break regeneration of the live download page. LIC-2 therefore owns one narrow
compatibility correction: update-site ingestion may exempt only exact
`0.4.0-dev.24` macOS evidence from that newly introduced check. Candidate
construction, Draft publication admission, `dev.33`, and every unknown version
remain strict. Positive legacy regeneration plus `dev.33` and unknown-version
negative tests are required before the exact-head matrix is accepted.
The affected candidate/update-site sources and publication workflows must also
trigger that matrix, and stable jobs must execute the update-site self-test.

## Remaining Gates

1. **PASS** — implement, review, validate, and protected-integrate the bounded
   Provider and file-lane source repairs plus AGPL LIC-1.
2. **PASS** — implement and integrate SP-READY1, publish its policy links,
   enable private vulnerability reporting, and apply a no-bypass default-
   branch review ruleset.
3. **PASS** — protected-integrate PR #46, regenerate the public site, and
   verify its linked policy, pending-application disclosure, and visible
   uninstall guidance. Exact head/main runs `31563972114`/`31576354218` and
   deployment run `31646300758` bind this evidence.
4. Obtain organization-owner MFA verification, submit and receive the SignPath
   Foundation decision, and install/configure the GitHub App without guessing
   organization, project, policy, or artifact-configuration identifiers.
5. Implement and validate the production two-stage executable/NSIS signing
   package with the real configuration and fail-closed negative/recovery paths.
6. After Windows-signing disposition, run one protected
   candidate workflow against the exact current upstream default-branch commit and
   independently verify Draft assets, hashes, identities, macOS trust evidence,
   and Draft-only state.
7. Perform exact installed `dev.33` References/Rename/editor-intelligence,
   Data Viewer, Issue #33, live-Provider repair, proposal Accept/verified Undo,
   startup, update, upgrade, uninstall, and Windows acceptance in proportion to
   the carried release risk.
8. Resolve Issue #26's Windows signing disposition without treating an
   unsigned installer as a public-release pass.
9. Prove the exact root `LICENSE` and `LICENSES.md` are bundled under the fixed
   Rho resource path, the About action reveals the installed license offline,
   and the installed bytes match the candidate source on both platforms.
10. Reconcile candidate evidence, then stop for explicit MAC5 GO. Publication
   and updater mutation remain separate actions.

## Current Decision

The original source repair, version synchronization, complete validation,
hosted matrices, AGPL LIC-1/LIC-2, and their protected integration pass.
SP-READY1 implementation, review, exact-head/main hosted validation,
integration, initial public policy deployment, private reporting, and default-
branch rules pass. PR #46 public-guidance integration and live deployment also
pass. Organization-owner MFA review, SignPath Foundation application/decision,
approved-project GitHub App/trusted-build configuration, production two-stage
Windows signing, and Issue #26's signing disposition remain open.
Current decision remains `NO-GO` for candidate construction. Exact candidate,
installed acceptance, acceptance upload, MAC5, public publication, and
candidate update-site mutation remain open.
