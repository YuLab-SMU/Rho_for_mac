# Agent Conversation Concurrency And Resource Scheduling

Status: active; Issue #5 authorized end-to-end, CONV-1 through CONV-3 source
checkpoints accepted 2026-08-09; CONV-3-R1 implemented/reviewed, and exact
`dev.27` upstream integration, two-platform candidate, owner-installed
seven-workflow acceptance, acceptance asset, and MAC5 GO pass; final evidence
integration, Issue comment/closure, and the distinct public Release gate remain
open

Date: 2026-08-09

Authorization: the project owner explicitly requested implementation of GitHub
Issue #5 through the point where the issue can be closed on 2026-08-09

Change class: D3 shared Agent architecture, persistence, scheduling, approval,
and desktop workflow

Risk class: R3 schema migration, execution admission, cancellation, approval,
project switching, recovery, and project-file mutation

Current work package: final `dev.27` acceptance evidence integration and Issue
#5 comment/closure; public publication remains a separate release decision

Mandatory stop: the bounded recovery, two-project/restart regressions, full
affected validation/review, upstream integration, exact candidate, and all
seven installed workflows pass. Integrate the factual ledger and close Issue
#5 only after the final comment links exact source, CI, and installed evidence;
do not infer authority to publish the Draft or mutate the update site.

## Problem And Reproduction

GitHub Issue #5 records a product-level dead end: while one Agent task is
running, global `Working` state disables the composer, so the user cannot start
or use an unrelated Agent conversation without cancelling the first task.

The current implementation is single-flight at several independent layers:

- the desktop command rejects `run_agent` while `agent_tasks` is non-empty;
- the frontend derives one global `agentBusy`, one `activeAgentTurnId`, and one
  global cancel action from every project turn;
- `recent_agent_conversation()` supplies project-wide recent turns to every
  new turn, so unrelated work is not context-isolated;
- pending approval waiters are keyed only by request ID and per-turn cancel
  currently calls `cancel_all()`;
- Task Rail rows represent turns, not durable conversations;
- project-wide history deletion is the only destructive history action.

Removing only the frontend or backend single-flight check would therefore mix
model context, misroute approvals, and allow cancellation of one task to affect
another. The invariant for this stream is:

> Conversation owns conversational context. Turn owns one execution. The Rust
> broker owns bounded concurrency and resource admission. Workspace R remains
> the only live scientific authority, and file mutation remains exact,
> project-contained, revision-aware, and recoverable.

## Goals

- Let a user create and switch to a second Agent conversation while another
  conversation has a running task.
- Persist conversation identity, output, approval association, state, retry
  lineage, and terminal reason by normalized project root.
- Allow bounded parallel Agent R/model work when it does not require an
  exclusive shared resource.
- Isolate cancellation, approval, retry, and deletion to the selected
  conversation or exact turn.
- Serialize Workspace R access truthfully and reject stale mutations.
- Prevent concurrent file proposals from silently overwriting the same file.
- Preserve deterministic restart recovery and project-switch blocking.
- Keep real Tauri commands and browser/mock behavior in lockstep.

## Non-Goals

- A second authoritative Workspace R session.
- Parallel execution inside Ark or concurrent mutation of live R objects.
- Multi-user, remote, cloud, or cross-device conversations.
- Background operation after Rho exits.
- Unrestricted filesystem, shell, package-installation, Git, environment, or
  credential authority.
- Prompt-classified permission or resource ownership.
- Migrating direct UI environment operations into Agent approvals.
- Increasing model-provider credential exposure.

## Authority And Cross-Review

- ADR-003 retains authenticated single-use Agent R transport. Each concurrent
  turn receives its own listener, token, child process, and credential scope.
- The active roadmap retains Workspace R as the single authority for live
  objects and project execution. This stream adds Agent R processes, never a
  second Workspace R.
- The implemented Agent handoff retains Ask/Plan/Act policy, exact tool
  approval, revisions, event persistence, and restart truth.
- UX4-P2 and the Issue #9 Task Rail specification retain navigation,
  status/mode/risk presentation, keyboard, and accessibility rules. This
  stream changes Task Rail rows from turns to conversations but does not merge
  mode, status, or approval semantics.
- Agent File Editing V1 retains proposal parsing, project containment, stale
  editor anchors, atomic writes, and Undo. This stream adds admission and
  conflict ownership around that existing mutation path.
- AFO-1 retains exact-turn, in-memory Act auto-apply authorization. It never
  transfers to another turn or conversation.
- The environment-operation contract retains its dedicated request table and
  dialog. Direct UI environment operations are not Agent turns and are not
  cancelled by an Agent action.
- BH1 retains normalized project identity and two-project isolation. BH2
  retains broker-owned project switching. BH3 supplies the transactional,
  backup, assertion, and failure-injection migration pattern. BH4 retains
  destructive-history and retention truth.
- Model routing retains one resolved effective route and credential per turn.
  A running turn is unaffected by later settings changes.

No active document authorizes competing conversation, scheduler, approval, or
Workspace R state. The active cross-review matrix records this stream as the
sole owner of Agent Conversation identity and multi-turn admission.

## Terminology And Identity

### Conversation

A Conversation is a durable, project-scoped thread visible in Task Rail. It
has a stable opaque `conversation_id`, a bounded title, creation/update times,
and zero or more turns. Conversation is the product term; `R session` remains
reserved for Workspace R or Agent R process identity.

An empty Conversation is allowed so `New conversation` has a durable target
before a prompt is sent. At most one nonterminal Turn may belong to a given
Conversation. Starting a second turn in that Conversation while one is
running or waiting is rejected at the broker even if the UI is stale.

### Turn

A Turn is one immutable prompt/execution attempt with one recorded mode,
effective model, editor context, events, approvals, output, and terminal
result. Retry creates another Turn in the same Conversation; it never mutates
the original Turn.

### Resource lane

A resource lane is broker-owned transient admission state, not a user-visible
conversation and not a second durable source of project truth. V1 lanes are:

- `model`: bounded concurrent Agent R/model work;
- `workspace`: fair, cancellation-safe exclusive access to Workspace R request
  dispatch;
- `file:<normalized-project-relative-path>`: exclusive apply/undo admission
  for one project file.

## Persistence Contract

Schema v12 adds:

```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_conversations (
  conversation_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  project_root TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (project_root <> ''),
  title TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (length(title) BETWEEN 1 AND 240),
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  archived_at TEXT,
  legacy_unthreaded INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
    CHECK (legacy_unthreaded IN (0, 1))
);

CREATE TABLE agent_conversation_turns (
  turn_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  conversation_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  retry_of_turn_id TEXT,
  terminal_reason TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY(turn_id) REFERENCES agent_turns(turn_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY(conversation_id) REFERENCES agent_conversations(conversation_id)
    ON DELETE RESTRICT,
  FOREIGN KEY(retry_of_turn_id) REFERENCES agent_turns(turn_id)
    ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

Required indexes cover `(project_root, updated_at DESC)` and
`(conversation_id, turn_id)`. Every current-schema Agent turn has exactly one
mapping row. The mapping table is an additive compatibility bridge that avoids
rebuilding `agent_turns` and its approval/event/environment foreign-key graph.
It is authoritative for Conversation ownership.

Conversation creation and first-turn creation are transactions. A first Turn
may replace only the exact default `New conversation` title with its bounded
prompt preview. Later turns never silently rename the Conversation.

### Historical migration

The v11-to-v12 migration creates one synthetic, visibly labelled
`Legacy project history` Conversation for each distinct project root that has
Agent turns, maps those turns in their existing order, and sets
`legacy_unthreaded = 1`. This records only the provable historical fact that
the old implementation supplied project-wide history; it does not infer
separate historical threads. Legacy history is viewable and deletable but not
continuable. A new prompt always uses a new non-legacy Conversation.

The migration uses a same-directory pre-migration backup, one transaction,
copy-count and one-to-one mapping assertions, foreign-key checks, injected
failure rollback, and idempotent reopen. Unsupported or malformed historical
data fails closed without advancing schema version.

### Status and terminal reason

Existing durable Turn statuses remain `running`, `waiting`, `completed`,
`failed`, and `interrupted`. `terminal_reason` distinguishes at least
`user_cancelled`, `desktop_shutdown`, `desktop_restart`, `agent_failure`, and
`resource_stale`. The UI presents `Cancelled` only for
`status=interrupted, terminal_reason=user_cancelled`; other interruption
reasons remain `Interrupted`.

Conversation status is derived, never independently persisted:

1. a nonterminal turn: `running` or `waiting`;
2. otherwise the latest turn terminal status/reason;
3. no turns: `empty`.

## Command And Store Contract

New project-scoped commands:

- `list_agent_conversations(limit)` returns bounded Conversation summaries;
- `create_agent_conversation()` creates and returns one empty Conversation;
- `delete_agent_conversation(conversation_id)` transactionally deletes only
  one inactive Conversation and its turns/events/approvals;
- `retry_agent_turn(turn_id)` starts a new Turn in the same non-legacy
  Conversation using the immutable original prompt, mode, and editor context,
  with the currently resolved compatible model route recorded as effective;
- `list_agent_turns(conversation_id, limit)` lists only the selected thread.

`run_agent` accepts `conversation_id`. Omission creates a new Conversation for
compatibility. A supplied ID must be a non-legacy, non-archived Conversation
owned by the normalized active project and must have no nonterminal Turn.

Every detail, approval, retry, delete, context-history, and cancellation lookup
validates both active project and durable Conversation/Turn ownership at the
store boundary. Frontend filtering is not authorization.

Limits:

- at most 100 returned conversations and 100 returned turns per request;
- Conversation title at most 240 Unicode scalar values after trimming;
- model context at most four prior completed/failed turns from the exact
  Conversation, retaining existing text bounds and redaction;
- no prompt, model response, source, approval argument, or credential is added
  to diagnostics beyond existing bounded records.

## Concurrency And Scheduling Contract

### Model admission

- At most two Agent Turns may be nonterminal across the active project.
- Admission is atomic under the task registry lock and rejects duplicate or
  same-Conversation starts with a stable error code/message.
- Each accepted turn gets an independent Agent R process, transport token,
  child handle, credential override, event stream, and cancellation token.
- A failed spawn or registration releases capacity and durably finishes only
  that turn.

### Workspace R

- Workspace R remains one Ark session.
- Model-only work proceeds concurrently.
- Every Agent tool request that touches Workspace R enters one fair exclusive
  broker lane. Waiting for this lane is cancellable and visible as a bounded
  `resource.waiting` event.
- Authorization and revision checks are repeated after the lane is acquired;
  approval granted against a stale revision is rejected and the Agent must
  refresh/replan.
- Cancellation while queued performs no Workspace operation. Cancellation
  after dispatch uses the existing Workspace run cancellation/interrupt
  contract; completion truth follows the recorded run.

### Files

- Proposal generation remains read-only and may occur concurrently.
- Accept/auto-apply/Undo acquires an exclusive lane for the normalized
  project-relative path.
- Before mutation, the existing editor anchors plus an exact before-content
  digest are revalidated after lane acquisition.
- Different files may be applied independently. Two proposals for the same
  file never overwrite silently: the later proposal either observes the exact
  expected content and proceeds or becomes `resource_stale` with a visible
  regenerate/review action.
- Before touching disk, Apply/Undo persists a mutation-start record containing
  one opaque mutation identity plus expected-before and intended-after
  digest/absence truth. A terminal event records success, failure, stale,
  cancellation, recovered success/not-applied, or outcome uncertainty.
- Startup and project activation reconcile every incomplete start against the
  contained current file exactly once. Only an exact intended-after match is
  recovered as applied/undone, only an exact expected-before match is
  recovered as not applied, and every other observation remains uncertain
  with mutation controls withheld.
- Path lanes are released on success, rejection, failure, cancellation, and
  panic/unwind. They do not survive process restart; durable content/revision
  checks remain the recovery authority.

Direct environment operations remain in their own broker-owned lane and their
own request table/dialog. This stream does not reuse `approval_requests` for
them.

## Approval And Cancellation Isolation

Pending Agent approval waiters are stored as request ID plus owning turn ID.
The registry provides `cancel_turn(turn_id, reason)` in addition to the
shutdown-only `cancel_all(reason)`. Cancelling one turn:

- removes and aborts only that turn's task/process;
- cancels only approval waiters owned by that turn;
- interrupts only durable approvals for that turn;
- releases only that turn's queued resource claims;
- records `interrupted/user_cancelled` only for that turn;
- emits a turn-scoped update event.

Application shutdown and Workspace restart may use explicit global
reconciliation, but they must record truthful terminal reasons for every
affected turn. Direct UI environment-operation waiters are never cancelled by
an Agent-turn action.

## Project Switching And Recovery

- Project switching remains blocked while any Turn is running/waiting, any
  Agent approval is waiting, or an Agent-owned Workspace/file mutation is in
  flight. The blocker reports the total and one representative opaque ID.
- Conversation creation, Agent Turn/file-claim admission and cancellation,
  selected Conversation deletion/history clearing, and project-switch
  preflight share one broker transition gate.
  Whichever operation enters first establishes the project/claim state seen by
  the next operation; project switching cannot pass preflight in the gap
  between project lookup and resource registration.
- Switching never migrates a running Conversation to another project.
- Startup marks all historically nonterminal Turns interrupted with
  `desktop_restart`, interrupts their waiting approvals, and derives the
  affected Conversation states from those durable Turn records.
- Completed conversations and selected outputs remain available after Agent R
  or desktop restart.
- A crash after an external mutation but before final persistence must not be
  reported as a clean failure. Existing run/revision/file truth is reconciled
  and the UI reports uncertainty or stale state explicitly.

## User Experience Contract

### Task Rail

- Task Rail rows represent Conversations and the header reads
  `Conversations (N)`.
- Each row contains one aggregate status dot, the latest Turn's neutral mode
  icon when present, a one-line title, and accessible status/mode text.
- Selection uses `aria-current`; rows remain keyboard focusable and long
  Unicode titles ellipsize without widening the rail.
- `New conversation` remains enabled while other Conversations run once
  parallel admission is active.
- An empty selected Conversation displays a focused composer and no borrowed
  turn, output, approval, or file proposal.

### Conversation detail and actions

- The timeline shows only Turns belonging to the selected Conversation.
- The header reports aggregate counts such as `2 running · 1 waiting approval`
  while per-row state remains authoritative.
- Cancel, Retry, and Delete act on the selected exact Conversation/Turn.
- Delete is unavailable for an active Conversation, requires an explicit
  destructive confirmation, is transactional, and does not clear other
  Conversations.
- Pending approvals and file proposals display only when owned by the selected
  Turn. Another Conversation's pending decision produces a badge/status on its
  Task Rail row, never a fallback decision panel in the selected thread.
- The composer is disabled only when the selected Conversation has a
  nonterminal Turn or the global two-turn bound is reached. Running work in a
  different Conversation alone does not disable it.
- The model/mode selector configures the next Turn. Existing running Turns keep
  their recorded effective model and mode.

Loading, empty, success, waiting, running, failed, cancelled, interrupted,
stale, unavailable, narrow-window, keyboard, and screen-reader labels are
covered in deterministic mock/browser scenarios.

## Work Packages And Stops

### CONV-1: Durable Conversation identity and switching — source checkpoint complete

- schema v12 additive Conversation/mapping tables and migration;
- Conversation store types, transactional create/list/delete primitives, and
  exact-thread context lookup;
- Tauri commands and browser/mock parity for create/list/select;
- Task Rail Conversation projection and selected-thread timeline;
- `run_agent` binds a Turn to the selected Conversation;
- keep the current global one-running-turn admission rule;
- no concurrent execution, retry command, per-turn waiter redesign, or file
  scheduler yet.

Stop after migration/store/Tauri/frontend tests, two-project isolation,
browser review, migration failure/reopen evidence, and contract review.

The mandatory stop was reached on 2026-08-09. Evidence is recorded in
`docs/verification/agent-conversation-concurrency/conv1.md`. That evidence and
Draft PR #11 were reviewed as the CONV-2 entry gate; no unresolved P0/P1
finding remains.

### CONV-2: Bounded read-only parallel Turns — source checkpoint complete

- atomic two-Turn admission across distinct Conversations;
- per-turn process/task/cancellation and approval waiter ownership;
- aggregate header and selected-Conversation composer logic;
- model-only concurrent Ask/Plan and serialized Workspace reads;
- cancellation/restart/project-switch failure coverage.

Do not activate until CONV-1 is accepted at its mandatory stop.

Activation decision: the CONV-1 source checkpoint is accepted. CONV-2 may
change admission, in-memory task/waiter ownership, read-only Workspace
scheduling, and the matching Conversation UI/mock behavior. It must reject
concurrent Act Turns and must not add mutation scheduling, Retry, or
Conversation Delete behavior owned by CONV-3.

The mandatory stop was reached on 2026-08-09. Evidence is recorded in
`docs/verification/agent-conversation-concurrency/conv2.md`. The accepted
boundary permits two Ask/Plan Turns in distinct Conversations, retains
exclusive Act admission, serializes Workspace R requests, and isolates exact
Turn cancellation and approval ownership. A separate activation review then
admitted CONV-3; this sentence records the historical CONV-2 boundary rather
than constraining the active package.

### CONV-3: Mutation scheduling, retry, and deletion — source checkpoint complete

- revision-rechecked Workspace mutation lane;
- per-path file apply/Undo lane and digest conflict handling;
- exact-turn Retry and selected-Conversation Delete;
- Act concurrency only after approval and resource tests pass;
- installed-app workflow covering two concurrent Conversations.

Do not activate until CONV-2 is accepted at its mandatory stop.

Activation decision: the CONV-2 evidence and Draft PR #11 source boundary were
reviewed with no unresolved P0/P1 finding. CONV-3 may add broker-owned
per-path mutation admission and content-digest revalidation around the existing
file-edit commands, enable bounded Act concurrency only after those gates are
covered, add exact immutable Retry and selected-Conversation Delete commands,
and complete installed/integration acceptance. Existing file-edit placement,
atomic write, project containment, Undo, exact-turn Act authorization,
Workspace R authority, BH4 deletion truth, and direct environment-operation
ownership remain unchanged.

The mandatory source stop was reached on 2026-08-09. Evidence is recorded in
`docs/verification/agent-conversation-concurrency/conv3.md`. Mutation admission,
durable recovery, exact Apply/Undo state, project-transition ordering,
Retry/Delete, two-project isolation, browser/mock parity, the complete affected
matrix, and independent R3 review pass with no unresolved P0/P1 finding.
Replacement integration and hosted candidate evidence pass. Owner-installed
acceptance and Issue closure remain open factual gates.

### Hosted Windows contract portability amendment

Authoritative candidate attempt `31336769848`, bound to upstream commit
`9baf1ea199dae30317a309f9873e34a269f4fd40`, reproduced a release-blocking
validation defect on 2026-08-09. The Windows checkout converted tracked text to
CRLF, while `test-agent-conversation-concurrency.mjs` required one cross-line
specification phrase to contain a literal LF. The same product source and
contract passed on macOS; Windows failed before installer construction. R
package `curl` replacement messages in the job annotations were non-fatal and
are not the failed assertion.

The invariant for the bounded correction is that deterministic source-contract
readers compare logical text independently of checkout line endings. The test
must normalize CRLF and lone CR to LF before cross-line assertions and must
include a direct CRLF/lone-CR regression assertion. It must not weaken any
required phrase, source, metadata, identity, or behavior assertion. The repair
changes no Conversation schema, runtime behavior, authority, UI, R package, or
credential surface.

Because the failed combined run produced and submitted a signed `dev.25` macOS
artifact, the release checklist's single-use rule consumes that identity even
though no tag, draft Release, or public asset was created. Replacement source
must advance all application and candidate defaults to `0.4.0-dev.26`, retain
schema v12 and the existing R package versions, pass the focused portability
contract locally, and then pass a fresh exact-commit two-platform candidate
run. Cross-run artifacts, receipts, or hashes remain non-composable.

The bounded correction was source-verified, rebase-integrated through PR #12,
and became authoritative upstream commit
`a5fc4a153bb420968155984bf8e980973c775015`. Protected candidate run
`31337666426` then passed the complete Windows validation and installer smoke,
the signed/notarized/stapled macOS DMG chain and Workspace smoke, and immutable
candidate aggregation. It created one unpublished `v0.4.0-dev.26` Draft
prerelease. The exact DMG is 21120068 bytes with SHA-256
`6fdfd492e07cfc5c0aa70e77fbc781206f43d87dd81063e3ef85170c2fdfd540`.
The Draft and its seven existing assets remain immutable and unpublished.
Installed acceptance was attempted and rejected this identity; no acceptance
asset, MAC5 GO, public Release, or update-site mutation exists.

### CONV-3-R1: selected Conversation recovery amendment

Owner-installed acceptance against exact `dev.26` reproduced a deterministic
restart defect on 2026-08-10. After selecting a non-first Conversation, waiting
for ordinary session persistence, quitting normally, and reopening the exact
installed application, Rho selected the first Conversation instead. Durable
turn output, retry lineage, file-mutation events, schema 12, and the normalized
project root all recovered correctly. The failure is therefore selection
recovery, not Conversation-store loss or migration failure.

The root cause is a missing ownership bridge: frontend
`selectedConversationId` was reset during project hydration, the project
session snapshot did not carry it, and selecting or creating a Conversation
did not schedule a session save. The regression invariant is:

> The selected Conversation is project-scoped session state. A normal save,
> quit, reopen, or project round trip restores the exact selection only when
> that Conversation still belongs to the normalized active project; missing,
> malformed, deleted, or foreign-project identifiers fall back truthfully and
> the repaired fallback is persisted.

CONV-3-R1 is an additive project-session compatibility change. The JSON session
snapshot adds nullable `selected_agent_conversation_id`; historical snapshots
default it to `null`. It does not change SQLite schema 12, Conversation or Turn
ownership, approval policy, model credentials, execution authority, file
mutation authority, Workspace R, or R package contracts. Hydration may treat a
bounded non-empty string as a provisional selection, but the authoritative
project-filtered Conversation list must validate membership before any detail,
approval, output, or action is projected. Project A's saved identifier must
never select or expose a Conversation in project B.

Every explicit Conversation selection and newly created Conversation schedules
the project session save. Load-time fallback after deletion, malformed history,
or foreign-project input also schedules a repaired snapshot. The existing
request-sequence and normalized-project checks remain the asynchronous response
boundary.

Required focused evidence is: Rust project-session round trip, legacy/default
compatibility, malformed-session recovery, and two-project isolation; frontend
contract coverage for save, restore, membership validation, and repaired
fallback; JavaScript syntax and Rust formatting; then the complete affected
Rust, R, and frontend matrix. Installed acceptance must repeat all seven Issue
#5 workflows against one new immutable candidate and must specifically prove
normal quit/reopen restores an explicitly non-first selected Conversation.
`dev.26` remains an immutable unpublished rejected Draft with no acceptance
asset. The replacement identity is `0.4.0-dev.27`; no `dev.26` artifact,
receipt, hash, or hosted evidence may be relabelled or composed into it.

### CONV-3-R2: deterministic different-file lane verification amendment

PR #30 exact-head Rust Compatibility run `31556192887` exposed a test-only
portability defect on Windows with Rust 1.88.0. Three matrix jobs passed, while
`different_agent_files_reach_disk_without_waiting_for_the_global_context_lock`
used a two-second filesystem polling deadline and treated runner scheduling
latency as proof that the global context lock serialized the file lanes. The
PR #30 diff does not change the affected Rust source, and the same exact commit
passed the Windows stable job, so retrying the failed job would not establish a
deterministic gate.

The bounded correction replaces filesystem polling with a test-only completion
counter and notification emitted immediately after each successful atomic
Apply write. The regression holds the global context lock, waits for both
different-path completion signals under one 30-second deadlock watchdog, then
verifies both exact disk contents before releasing the lock. A lost notification
cannot create a false failure because the counter is authoritative. The
control, field, imports, and notification compile only under `cfg(test)`; the
production mutation path, persistence, schema, scheduling, approval, recovery,
UI, R packages, version metadata, and release identity remain unchanged.

Acceptance requires Rust formatting, repeated focused execution, the complete
locked Rust workspace tests, `git diff --check`, review that the non-test build
contains no test-control state, and a fresh macOS/Windows × stable/1.88.0 hosted
matrix. This R2 validation repair has no application or R package version impact
and does not require a `NEWS.md` entry.

Local implementation and post-test contract review passed on 2026-08-12. The
focused regression passed 20 consecutive executions; Rust formatting, locked
all-target workspace check, the complete locked workspace test suite, JavaScript
syntax, every `scripts/test-*.mjs` contract, and `git diff --check` passed. Code
review confirms every new controller field, type, import, initialization, and
notification is `cfg(test)`-only. Exact-head Rust Compatibility run
`31557415624` then passed macOS and Windows on both stable and Rust 1.88.0,
including the formerly failing Windows/MSRV lane. PR #43 integrated the repair
as upstream merge commit `3a3546bd76cc11761263a5af8e060ba73a4a0580`.

## Verification Matrix

### Migration and store

- empty v12 bootstrap;
- v7, v8, v9, v10, and v11 upgrade fixtures;
- one synthetic legacy history per project and one mapping per legacy Turn;
- no cross-project mapping, duplicate mapping, or unprovable continuation;
- injected failure retains old schema/version and backup; reopen succeeds;
- foreign keys, indexes, copy counts, idempotent current-schema reopen;
- projects A and B with identical Conversation titles and Turn prompts remain
  isolated for list/detail/context/delete/retry.

### Admission, approval, and recovery

- two different Conversations run concurrently; a third is rejected;
- a second nonterminal Turn in one Conversation is rejected;
- two model-only turns finish without context/event/output mixing;
- one spawn/provider/process failure leaves the other running;
- cancel A does not cancel B, B's approval, or direct environment operation;
- cancel while waiting for Workspace/file lane performs no mutation;
- shutdown/restart reconciles each nonterminal Turn exactly once;
- normal save/quit/reopen restores the exact project-owned selected
  Conversation, while stale, malformed, deleted, and foreign-project saved IDs
  fall back and repair the session snapshot;
- project switch reports all active blocker classes without cross-project data.

### Workspace and file conflicts

- independent read requests are serialized without losing either response;
- approval becomes stale while queued and cannot mutate Workspace R;
- two same-file proposals result in one exact apply and one stale/conflict;
- different-file proposals can apply independently;
- create-existing, edit-missing, changed editor version/digest, command failure,
  cancellation, Undo-after-change, and project switch fail truthfully;
- Act auto-apply authority remains exact-turn and never crosses Conversation.

### UI and mock

- zero, one, many, legacy, long Unicode, running, waiting, failed, cancelled,
  and unavailable Conversation rows;
- switching preserves selected output, activity, approval, and proposal;
- New Conversation works while another model-only Turn runs;
- only the selected active Turn can be cancelled;
- Retry creates a linked Turn without rewriting history;
- Delete rejects active state and removes only the confirmed Conversation;
- exact desktop and narrow viewport, keyboard order/focus restoration,
  accessible mode/status names, overflow, and browser/Tauri command parity.

Required completion evidence includes focused store/server/desktop tests,
complete Rust workspace tests, both R package suites, every affected frontend
contract, JavaScript syntax, formatting, release metadata, `git diff --check`,
deterministic browser review, independent R3 safety/contract review, and a
representative installed macOS application workflow. Text-scanning contracts
must also prove that LF, CRLF, and lone-CR input produce the same logical-text
assertions on supported checkout platforms.

## Version, NEWS, Release, And Issue Closure

The integrated behavior first advanced application metadata and `NEWS.md` to
the single-use `0.4.0-dev.25` development identity. Candidate attempt
`31336769848` exhausted that identity after producing a rejected macOS artifact;
the bounded validation repair advances the replacement candidate to the
single-use `0.4.0-dev.26` identity. Installed acceptance then exhausted and
rejected `dev.26` after its selected Conversation failed normal restart
recovery. CONV-3-R1 advances the next replacement candidate to the single-use
`0.4.0-dev.27` identity. Schema v12 must never be shipped under the already
published immutable `0.4.0-dev.24` identity or relabelled across the rejected
`dev.25`, rejected `dev.26`, and replacement `dev.27` attempts.

No R package version change is expected unless implementation demonstrates a
required exported `rho.agent` or `rho.bridge` contract change. Agent R process
parallelism alone is desktop/broker behavior.

Issue #5 may close only when:

1. CONV-1 through CONV-3 are implemented and contract-reviewed;
2. every issue expectation and acceptance item has direct automated and
   installed-app evidence;
3. schema/recovery, approval/cancel isolation, Workspace/file conflict, and
   two-project tests pass;
4. application version metadata and NEWS are synchronized;
5. exact source is committed, pushed, and integrated into upstream `main`;
6. required CI checks pass;
7. an Issue comment links the exact commit/PR, tests, and installed evidence;
8. the GitHub Issue is then closed as completed.

Passing only CONV-1 or CONV-2 is progress and must not close the Issue.

At the 2026-08-10 acceptance checkpoint, conditions 1 through 6 pass. PR #21
integrated the source as authoritative commit
`aff83f01d2db8c241fe794fe5e5e4c80d2baf2a0`; protected candidate run
`31391411316` passed both platforms and created unpublished Draft `367934137`.
The exact installed macOS candidate passed concurrent unrelated Conversations,
the two-Turn admission bound and exact cancellation, different-file progress
and same-file stale rejection, non-first selected Conversation restart
recovery, immutable Retry lineage, confirmed single-Conversation deletion, and
active-Turn project-switch blocking. The schema-v1 acceptance asset binds the
exact candidate and has SHA-256
`4ae9aec04105951d7cedda004444bfd9ab5972bd8ff20905897b2a70c505b151`.
Conditions 7 and 8 are intentionally performed only after this ledger is
integrated. The Draft remains unpublished.

## 2026-08-21 Ready Fast deterministic transition-order test repair

Phase 2 integration Ready Fast run `32459444429` exposed a test-only race in
`project_transition_orders_file_claim_before_switch_preflight`: the fixture
held the project-transition mutex, spawned Apply and Switch tasks, released the
mutex, then assumed the earlier-spawned Apply task would acquire it first.
Tokio does not make that spawn-order guarantee. When Switch won, the fixture
continued beyond file-mutation preflight and failed with `Workspace R is not
running`. The same failure reproduced in a focused local run; no production
runtime or Phase 2 source changed between earlier passing and failing runs.

The D1/R2 repair removes the scheduler assumption. The fixture still holds the
per-file lane, starts Apply, then waits with a bounded timeout until the real
`AgentFileMutationRegistry` exposes the queued exact-project/exact-path claim.
Only then does it start Switch and assert that preflight reports the Agent file
mutation blocker, cancellation removes exactly that queued claim, and neither
file content nor project state changes. A source contract fixes the explicit
registration-before-preflight synchronization marker so the fixture cannot
silently regress to spawn-order timing.

This repair changes test synchronization only. It adds no product mutex,
delay, retry, Workspace behavior, file authority, schema, command, application
or R-package version, `NEWS.md`, release or publication impact. Completion
requires repeated focused execution, the full desktop/workspace suite, the
Agent concurrency contract, formatting and diff checks, followed by fresh
Ready Fast and required protected checks on the repaired exact head.

Local repair evidence passed: the focused transition-order regression passed
20 consecutive executions; the Agent concurrency contract, Rust formatting,
locked all-target workspace check and complete locked workspace tests passed.
Desktop reported 270 passed with the existing opt-in Keychain test ignored.
The separately observed run-history scheduler window passed 20 focused runs
and the complete desktop/workspace rerun, so no unrelated timeout change was
included in this repair.
